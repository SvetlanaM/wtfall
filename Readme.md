# WTFALL company website

Simple static web page based on Bootstrap of our company
[wtfall](https://www.startitup.sk/svetlana-margetova-cez-vikendy-som-citala-knihy-o-algoritmoch/).
This is old website from 2012 year and my the very first website created on
Bootstrap technology and with the new grid system based on divs. Before this new
modern approach, I was created websites using HTML tables.

Wtfall was my very first digital agency, that I started as a student during my
studies on Masaryk University in Brno with my other 3 friends:

1. **Jozef Šimo** - designer
2. **Samuel Matis** - JS developer
3. **Peter Parada** - Python developer

We had our own project - DiscoverCity based in Denmark and EnabledCity based in
PaloAlto. Idea maker of these projects was Jožko.

# Technologies

1. HTML
2. Based on Bootstrap
3. Small JS code with jQuery and VanillaJS for form validations
4. PHP for form submissions
5. Custom CSS styling with media queries
